## Visual Alchemist

**Visual Alchemist** is a web app to seamlessly create `sqlalchemy` models by dragging/dropping objects in a canvas.

Presently, the tool just automates the code creation to build the corresponding `sqlite` database. Following features are coming soon:

- Implement joins and relations by drag/drop.
- Authentication/Sign-up.
- Ability to save the visual models on backend.
- Multi-language support (on-demand).

### Demo

Visit [http://valchemist-inn.rhcloud.com](http://valchemist-inn.rhcloud.com) to see a live demo of how this app works.

### Installation and Usage

Visual Alchemist is a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)-based app due to Flask's versatility & ability to accommodate future features.

To run VA, you'll need to install the minimum requires via the requirements.txt file. Run the following commands to install requirements in a virtual environment from within the application root directory (assuming you have pip and virtualenv installed: 

    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r
    deactivate

To run the app, go to the application root directory and type:

    venv/bin/python valchemist.py
    	
	
### Contribute

I need contributions in the following areas:
- **Front-end Testing:** To test the app across various Browser/OS environments to make sure it runs all-right.
- **Design:** My CSS/JavaScript skills aren't that great. So, if you can suggest any improvisation to the front-end workflow, it would be great!
- Need more suggestions from Python Experts regarding how can I improvise this app, so its useful somewhere.
