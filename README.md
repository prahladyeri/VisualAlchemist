- Ability to save the session for future use and `database versioning`.
- Ability to share sessions through URL.
- Multiple sessions in different tabs with ability to save them on backend.

## Demo

Visit [https://prahladyeri.github.io/VisualAlchemist](https://prahladyeri.github.io/VisualAlchemist) to see a live demo of how this app works.

## Installation

Visual Alchemist is a pure html app, so you can simply download the [source](https://github.com/prahladyeri/VisualAlchemist/archive/master.zip) and host it (with `index.html` as default).

## Documentation

Visual Alchemist is under active development, so there is no extensive documentation. However, a brief guide accompanies the app which should help most power users. If you don't understand anything, the best places to visit are the [issue tracker](https://github.com/prahladyeri/VisualAlchemist/issues) and the [VA subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisualAlchemist).

## Contribution

I'm presently looking for people who can contribute to Visual Alchemist. Mainly in the areas of:

1. Testing: Extensive alpha/beta testing, so our `v1.1` can be a big hit.
2. Code review: There is no such thing as bug-free code and more the number of eyeballs, the better it is.
3. Logo Design: Though a new logo is not immediately necessary, it is still a nice to have, though.
4. Documentation: Docs are very critical at this early of the project, and we don't have any apart from the basic guide accompnied by the app itself.
